# fantasy-island-sweepstakes
A commercial sweepstakes site for a fantasy world cruise company.

## Description
This is a final project for my Javascript class, simulating an interactive 
sweepstakes page for a world cruise, selecting random pairs of world cities,
accepting repeated choices by the user, and tallying the choices with a 
friendly "congratulations" message.

Employs Javascript, CSS, my own small library of common functions and 
wrappers to simplify the main code, as well as a bit of creative license
with the theme of the page.

## Known issues:
- The author could use a job to afford such a cruise.  ^_^
